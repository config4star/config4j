documentation (in PDF and HTML formats) on www.config4star.org.

The jar file will be put into the top-level "lib" directory.


Running "config2j" and "config4j"
---------------------------------

UNIX shell scripts and Windows ".bat" files for running "config2j" and
"config4j" are in the top-level "bin" directory. However, before using
those commands, you must; (1) set the CONFIG4J_HOME environment variable
to point to this top-level directory; and (2) add the "bin" directory to
your PATH environment variable.
